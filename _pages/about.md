**I'm currently on the job market! Please take a look of my <a href='/assets/pdf/Ewina_TKP_resume.pdf'>resume</a> and reach out if you are hiring a research scientist, software engineer, or other similar role.**

Hi, I am a graduating doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.braingate.org/">BrainGate team</a> at Brown University, under the supervision of Dr. Leigh Hochberg. My research focuses on designing stable and reliable brain-computer interfaces for long-term continuous clinical use for people with tetraplegia. 

Prior to Brown, I completed both undergraduate and master degree at the University of Southern California from 2014-2018, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering respectively. My <a href="http://ewinapun.com/projects/2_project/">undergraduate thesis</a> focused on adaptive subspace identification algorithm for dynamic tracking. 

During my free time, I am a competitive ballroom dancer at Brown and enjoy baking and making artisan chocolates (level 1 certified by the International Institute of Chocolate and Cacao Tasting). My hobby list keeps growing, and I love learning new skills and traveling around the world.
