Hi, I am a graduating doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.braingate.org/">BrainGate team</a> at Brown University, under the supervision of Dr. Leigh Hochberg. My research focuses on designing stable and reliable brain-computer interfaces for long-term continuous clinical use for people with tetraplegia. 

Prior to Brown, I completed both undergraduate and master degree at the University of Southern California from 2014-2018, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering respectively. I wrote my <a href="http://ewinapun.com/projects/2_project/">undergraduate thesis</a> on adaptive subspace identification algorithm for dynamic tracking. During my free time, I am a competitive ballroom dancer at Brown and love making artisan chocolates (level 1 certified by the International Institute of Chocolate and Cacao Tasting).
