I completed my Ph.D. at Brown University, under the supervision of Dr. Leigh Hochberg in the <a href="https://www.braingate.org/">BrainGate team</a>. My research focuses on designing stable and reliable brain-computer interfaces for long-term continuous clinical use for people with tetraplegia. 

Prior to Brown, I completed both undergraduate and master degree at the University of Southern California from 2014-2018, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering respectively. I have research experience on BioMEMS design for implantable device and adaptive subspace identification algorithm for dynamic tracking in BCI. 

During my free time, I am a competitive ballroom dancer at Brown, and enjoy baking and making artisan chocolates (level 1 certified by the International Institute of Chocolate and Cacao Tasting). My hobby list keeps growing, and I love learning new skills and traveling around the world.
