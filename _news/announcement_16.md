<a href='http://ewinapun.com/publications'>Our paper</a>, *"Months-long high-performance fixed LSTM decoder for cursor control in human intracortical brain-computer interfaces"*, co-written with my colleague, was published in the 2023 11th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER). I was honored to present this work at the conference in Baltimore, Maryland.
