My <a href='http://ewinapun.com/publications'>paper, "Months-long high-performance fixed LSTM decoder for cursor control in human intracortical brain-computer interfaces"</a>,, co-written with my colleague, was accepted in the 11th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER). I was honored presented this work at the conference in Baltimore, Maryland.
