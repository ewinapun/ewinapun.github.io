My paper, "Months-long high-performance fixed LSTM decoder for cursor control in human intracortical brain-computer interfaces", co-written with my colleague, was accepted 11th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER). I was honored presented this work at the conference in Baltimore, Maryland.
