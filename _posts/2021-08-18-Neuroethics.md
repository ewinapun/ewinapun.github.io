For the past twenty years, BrainGate has been focusing on helping paralyzed people to restore their ability to communicate or navigate or interact with the environment. By recording the person's neural activity, researchers are able to map thoughts into actions, allowing the participant to move a cursor or a robotic arm with ease. From cochlear implants and pacemakers, to deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, there's no doubt that neurotechnologies have helped and will continue to benefit people with neurological disorders. Millions of fundings from the Brain Initiative, DARPA, and billionaries such as Elon Musk, also accelerate the rate of research and development, along with raising public's attention on the topic of Brain-computer interfaces.

There's a number of ethical issues arise from emerging neurotechnologies, especially when the therapy involves sending simulating signal from a computer to the human nervous system (information flows in both direction). Here I'm going to propose a number of questions that may trigger your thoughts. Note that I'm not discussing anything cyborg related, like human-AI integration. Although one may argue that a human with an electronic implanted in his body can be counted as cyborg. A whole field of cyborgology digs deeper into social, political and ethical implications of becoming part organic and part synthetic.

- Neuroethics is the study of ethical issues raised by our evolving understanding of the brain and our increasing capacity to monitor and influence it.
- Our vision: neuroethics can aid in navigating difficult questions that neuroscience research may pose to society and in communicating nuanced findings to the public.
- Neuroethics can help align research and research findings with societal values.
- One of the goals of the BRAIN Initiative is to ensure that ethics is considered in a serious and sustained manner and that all funded research adheres to the highest ethical standards.
Thought experiments?


# privacy and confidentiality

like fitbit
collecting & sharing data

# autonomy and agency
"People want to feel that they are intentionally acting rather than merely being acted upon. This means that when a person uses a robotic arm to reach their coffee cup, they feel responsibility over the actions of the device."
"if the device instead crushes that person’s hand, the user may be unsure of his responsibility for the action."
their ability to act freely and according to their own choices

it is a technology that can powerfully change activity in the organ that generates our sense of personhood

the therapy’s side effects. “Some effects that might be described as personality changes are more problematic than others

# Withdraw / explant / change mind



# Decision making for patients



# hackers and malign use



# patients engagement

What if there's a group of people who can't use the technology. Not available to everyone? Is it discrimination? Minimize risk of stigma and disadvantage of different groups (how to study and report findings that doesn't reinforce culture sterotypes)

# non biomedical application

mind-reading blah blah blah
