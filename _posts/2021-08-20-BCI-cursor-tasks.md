2D cursor tasks


## Considerations

dwell or click
bit rate


## Radial-8 task
repeatitive direction

## Grid task

A “high accuracy” Grid task required sustained selection of small targets (grid size n=15, dwell time=2 s, trial  timeout=10  s),  thus  penalizing  noisy  or  imprecise cursor  control.  

A  “high  speed”  task  presented  larger  grid targets  with  a  shorter  dwell  requirement  (grid  size  n=10, dwell time=0.5 s, trial timeout=5 s), thus penalizing slow movements  (through  the  risk  of  false  selections)  and requiring more rapid target selection to achieve a comparable bitrate.

Ahigh-performanceBCI decoder should  achieve  a high combined bitrate across both speed and accuracytasks. Therefore, each  decoder  was  evaluated  on  both  Grid  task configurations using the same optimized gain and smoothing
