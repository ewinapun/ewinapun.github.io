# Brain Areas

## Primary motor cortex (M1) in precentral gyrus (PCG)

# Premotor cortex (PMC)
## Sumpplementary motor area (SMA)
## PMd
## PMv

refer to Rizzolatti 2001 & 1998 and Chouinard 2006 object lifting

## Primary sensory area (S1)

# Posterior parietal cortex (PPC)
posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex

Damage to the posterior parietal cortex can produce a variety of sensorimotor deficits, including deficits in the perception and memory of spatial relationships, inaccurate reaching and grasping, in the control of eye movement, and inattention.

## Anterior intraparietal area (AIP)
transformation from visual to motor
Direct connection to V1 via the dorsal stream / “where” pathway for information about size/shape of object
Found at junction of intraparietal sulcus and postcentral sulcus
Activation during hand motion:
● Visuomotor transformations
● Observation
● Execution of complex hand tasks

## Inferior Frontal Gyrus (F5 in NHP)

Located near Broca’s area / posterior to Brodmann’s 44
Most likely the closest F5 homologue in humans though could be dispersed throughout premotor cortex)
Activation during hand motion
● Observation and comprehension
● “ Object directed action execution”
○ Grasping, manipulating object, finger movements,
44 45
 
## Middle frontal gyrus

Suggest that MFG appears to engage in movement planning before an effector is determined. Also, MFG neurons are inherently sensitive to auditory stimuli, only when the stimuli is followed by cued action planning.

(Hosman et al., 2020)

## Visual cortex

## Auditory cortex

If we look at how information is processed in the brain, there's a hierarchy of level in the cortical network.
Hasson, Chen, and Honey, 2015 found that the timescales of information processing vary hierarchically across the cortex. Brain regions at the outer cortical network(higher-order regions) integrate infomration over longer windows than the innermost parts of the cortical network. They also exhibit more sluggish dynamics.

Leaky memory with reset can speed learning when data is smoothed in time, meaning consecutive samples are correlated, however, leaky-memory models perform worse than memory less models when the training categories are random/dissimilar items.
