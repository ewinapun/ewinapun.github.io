# Brain Areas

## Primary motor cortex (M1)

## Primary sensory area (S1)

## SMA

## Anterior Intraparietal Area (AIP)

## Inferior Frontal Gyrus (F5)

## PCG/MFG

## Visual cortex

## Auditory cortex

If we look at how information is processed in the brain, there's a hierarchy of level in the cortical network.
Hasson, Chen, and Honey, 2015 found that the timescales of information processing vary hierarchically across the cortex. Brain regions at the outer cortical network(higher-order regions) integrate infomration over longer windows than the innermost parts of the cortical network. They also exhibit more sluggish dynamics.

Leaky memory with reset can speed learning when data is smoothed in time, meaning consecutive samples are correlated, however, leaky-memory models perform worse than memory less models when the training categories are random/dissimilar items.
