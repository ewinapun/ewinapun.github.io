Earlier I had a discussion with another Ph.D. student who studies sensor design for BCI purposes. While he believes BCI breakthrough l

## Challenges

* recording high-dimensional and noisy
* output/biomarker unknown
* relevant  input unknown
* complex model not controllable
* brain is plastic and neural activity is time-varying
* intention is hidden
* spikes events are fast time-scale

## Neuron Plasticity

neuron patterns drive behavior
population of neurons reorganize
individual neuron change their preferred tuning
cortical map expanding, network connectivity
express new patten ability to perform new behavior, acquire new skills

changing decoder in a way to trigger fast or slow learning, to observe different tyepe of changes in neural activity
