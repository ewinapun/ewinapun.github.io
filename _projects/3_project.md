**Identifying changes in volitional state and BCI task engagement based on the intrinsic structure of neural ensemble activity patterns in motor cortex of people with tetraplegia**

On October 19 – 23, 2019, I attended Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual meeting in Chicago, IL, USA. I presented our research with a poster, titled “Identifying changes in volitional state and task engagement based on the intrinsic structure of neural ensemble activity patterns in motor cortex of people with tetraplegia during daily activities and BCI use” on 21/10. I also spent time visiting other posters and attending some symposiums.


Neuromotor deficits resulting from conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI) result in loss of volitional movement reducing independence. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) bypass damaged motor pathways and provide new links to assistive technologies. Voluntary action engages vast networks of neurons performing complex calculations which are still not fully understood. It is widely accepted that motor cortex incorporates a mix of incoming sensory, cognitive, and motor planning information, reflecting latent variables that are not directly related to kinematic motor output. Reliably identifying neural activity patterns indicative of a set of latent factors impacted by task and cognitive context is a challenge for developing BCI systems that support continuous, multi-effector use.
Here we present a new approach to generate state spaces based solely on the intrinsic properties of single unit ensemble recordings. We used Spike train SIMilarity Space (SSIMS) analysis to map neural activity patterns into low dimensional state spaces (based on spike train metrics combined with dimensionality reduction). These state space projections can be used to identify clusters of similar, recurring activity patterns, without the need to define task-related tuning models for individual neurons. We applied this method to data collected from two participants enrolled in the BrainGate2 clinical trial - T10, an adult male with tetraplegia due to SCI (C4 AIS-A), and T9, an adult male with tetraplegia due to ALS (ALSFRS-R of 8). T10 had two 96 microeletrode arrays (Blackrock Microsystem, Inc) implanted on the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and precentral gyrus (PCG), and T9 on the left PCG. We collected data during sessions where T10 & T9 controlled either a computer cursor or a JACO robotic arm to perform a 2D target acquisition task via intracortical BCI. We demonstrate that our approach can be used to generate state spaces that differentiate between effectors (cursor vs. robotic arm) in both T10 & T9 (81.4±8.0%, 99.5±0.58% accuracy). Additionally, we recorded data from T10 over a 24 hour period; we can identify 5 partially overlapping states related to session tasks, interaction with caretakers and others, engagement with a sip-and-puff computer system, eating, and sleeping (Nearest Neighbor Classifier: 46.5±0.6%, p<.01; against chance classification: 23.5±0.8%). Our findings suggest that state space models based on intrinsic similarity can be used to detect context-dependent changes in volitional state, providing a useful indicator of when BCI control modes should be adjusted.
