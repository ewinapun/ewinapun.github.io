I spent two years in USC Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory led by Dr. Ellis Meng working as an undergraduate research. One of the projects aims to treat Hydrocephalus via a pressure sensor. Hydrocephalus occurs when excessive cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, resulting in an abnormal widening of spaces that poses potentially life-threatening pressure against brain tissues. A new, flexible MEMS-based, low-powered and biocompatible in \textit{in-vivo} environment has been developed. This pressure sensor enables reliable sensing for chronic implantation and provides immediate access to actionable pressure data to drive timely therapeutic interventions. My project aims to characterize the transducer's design to maximize its sensitivity.
focuses on the application for hydrocephalus; also applicable to other common pressure-induced medical conditions such as hypertension and glaucoma


completely fill the microchannel with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) that mimics a wet in-vivo environment
create a microbubble by a current-induced electrolysis from the nuclear cores via a current source
chronically measure changes in impedence conducted through the liquid capillaries at the corners
